      Pharmacists are just as essential as any other health care provider for
      treating patients' conditions and advising them on their health concerns.
      You will become an expert in the science of medicine and with that you
      ensure patients receive the correct dosage of life-saving prescriptions,
      advise the other health care professionals on pharmacology, and be able to
      identify when one drug is dangerous or interacts with another. You are
      also a key component in offering tips for health, well-being, stress
      management, nutrition, how to stop smoking, and other lifestyle changes
      that will save people’s lives.
